Features planned to be implemented "soon":
- display winner's Victory portrait instead of Team leader portrait
- read victory quotes and display them on Victory screen
- mp3 support
- Tournament mode
- Time Attack mode
- Time Challenge mode
- Score Challenge mode
- Story mode
- additional parameters in storyboards needed for Story mode implementation
- global ranking system
- common1.cns and source code changes related to some of the above features
- characters unlocking adjustable in select.def [Options] section


Features that we're not able to implement currently, hopefully SUEHIRO (or someone else with good understanding of GO language) will be interested in helping us fix this:
FEATURED FROM WINMUGEN & WINMUGEN SCREENPACKS:
 - print errors to a new window with OK button before closing
 - survival mode implementation as infinite Turns mode
 - functions that globally sets music and sound volume (standard feature for options screen)
 - additional parameters for 'playBGM' function that allows us to set volume for this particular track as well as decide if it should loop (needed for accurate mugen screenpack implementation)
 - support for parallax animations via lua (using width, xscale, yscalestart, yscaledelta background parameters)
 - additional parameter for 'sndPlay' function that controls if sound should cancel previous sound, alternatively it could return sound length, so that we can handle it in lua (needed to implement 'random.move.snd.cancel' screenpack parameter)
 - 'drawFace' function should also render cell background (separate function for sprite), 'setRandomSpr' that this function uses should accept alpha parameters (mugen does), showempytboxes screenpack param should be taken into account, additional character flag to allow unlocking characters (currently ikemen plus doesn't use 'drawFace' at all due to these limitations, but the lua implementation is quite slow for large rosters. It could stay the way it is if there was some kind of optimization when it comes to rendering - instead of drawing 1000 faces one by one the engine could take a snapshot of once rendered faces and then just show it after refresh() instead of redrawing them individually)
 - 'textImgSetWindow' function (required for accurate implementation of mugen 'menu.window.margins.y' screenpack parameter)
FEATURED FROM MUGEN 1.0+:
 - FNTv2 fonts - alternatively I can implement it via pure lua using anim functions, but to do so information about sprite sizes and coordinates from SFF file would be needed
 - TTF fonts
 - R, G, B parameters for fonts
 - localcoord support (Needed for better compatibility with mugen screenpacks and lifebars, currently we are at winmugen compatibility level)
EVERYTHING ELSE:
 - function that returns userdata for chosen character's animation based on sent AIR anim reference (needed for character's animation in Select screen and Continue screen)
 - 'SimulType' CNS trigger (for example selectable via existing setTeamMode lua function) that sets character's flag ('none' by default, 'simul', 'tag' - needed for Select screen Tag mode selection, I have problem with editing bytecode.go)
